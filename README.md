# Signatio
A DeltaHacks project

## What does it do?
Uses machine learning and computer vision to gamify and break down the barriers of learning American Sign Language

## How does it do that?
Users will complete modules and unlock levels of higher difficulties that gradually build your ASL skills. As of now Signatio has:
- An initial module to guide the user through the entire ASL alphabet
- A second module generates a randomized multiple choice test to help users associate the English and ASL alphabet
- A third module tests our user's mastery of the alphabet by making them sign a letter without any aid
